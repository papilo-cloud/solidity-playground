# Proxy Pattern (Upgradeable Contract)

## Concept
A proxy contract that delegates calls to implementation, allowing logic upgrades without losing state.

### 🎯 Features
- Proxy stores state
- Implementation contains logic
- Upgrade to new implementation
- State persists across upgrades
- Non-upgradeable implementation
